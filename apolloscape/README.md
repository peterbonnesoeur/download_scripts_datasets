## Important for the car_model

The original dataset provides .pkl files for the 3D modelisation of the cars. 

HOWEVER, those documents are corrupted. The new documents are under a json formatting and canm be downloaded at the following url : https://www.kaggle.com/c/pku-autonomous-driving/data?select=car_models_json

The folder name is car_models_json and needs to be placed at the same level as car_poses in the train and sample folder.
